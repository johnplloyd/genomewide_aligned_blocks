# genomewide_aligned_blocks
This repository contains the Python scripts required to generate blocks of aligned nucleotides across multiple species. Optionally, phastCons conservation scores can then be calculated for each nucleotide in an aligned block.

The pipeline is explained on the Shiu Laboratory website:

An internal wrapper that automates the chaining and netting of alignments is described here:
